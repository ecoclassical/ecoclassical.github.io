I am an ecological macroeconomist and computational social scientist studying multi-sector growth and structural change in the pressing context of the climate crisis and social and regional disparities in economic development.

Facing compounding risks in climate (e.g. disasters in the form of heatwaves, droughts, floods, and wildfires) and geopolitics (e.g. de-globalization driven by ongoing trade wars and actual conflicts), I employ a wide range of quantitative methods (including dynamical systems, networks, input-output analysis, statistical inference, and machine learning) to address foundational ecological questions initially raised by the pioneering 19th-century classical economists as they sought to understand the early capitalist system:

- Are the limits to growth ultimately determined by limited natural resources or rather social inequality? 
- What are the complex dynamics of the metabolic rift between the economy and the environment, and how do these relate to income distribution and gender equality? 
- How closely do evolutionary changes in social reproduction mirror those in biological systems? 
- Is there a conservation law of economic value, and how does it interact with the environment and social inequality? 
- Are there identifiable templates or categories of countries based on their industrial network structures? 
- Can states leverage the dynamics of the economic system to foster environmental sustainability while promoting full employment, societal cohesion, and price stability? 
- Do climate policies centered in the Global North benefit or harm the Global South in terms of growth, employment, and financial stability, maybe requiring compensatory measures in the form of climate reparations?
- What is the complex architecture of ecological unequal exchange in the face of the climate crisis, as worldwide trade relies on the steady flow from the periphery to the core of labor and natural resources critical for the green transition, and what are its vulnerable points?
